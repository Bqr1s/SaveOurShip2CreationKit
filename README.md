This is the Creation Kit sub-mod for Save Our Ship 2, a mod for RimWorld. You can find the main repo at https://github.com/KentHaeger/SaveOurShip2. This mod is not intended to be used during normal gameplay; rather it is a set of tools for designing and exporting spaceships which can then be used as custom starting ships, enemies, or blueprints.

Requires Harmony (https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) and Vehicle Framework (https://github.com/SmashPhil/Vehicle-Framework), as well as SoS2 itself.

Developed by Kentington and Thain
